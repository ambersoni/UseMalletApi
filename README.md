# UseMalletApi
Mallet (http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/) is a great api for natural language processing.
This project aim to collect all use cases that I've use Mallet for real application.
For the fist commit, I've put classes that show 
(1) how to import data, 
(2) how to train LDA model with Mallet, 
(3) how to inference topic distribution for a new document based on the trained model
